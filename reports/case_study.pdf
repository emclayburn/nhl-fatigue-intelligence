NHL Fatigue Intelligence
Industry Analytics Case Study

Author: Ethan Clayburn
Focus: Sports Analytics & Machine Learning

Executive Summary

This case study presents an end-to-end machine learning system built to quantify how scheduling fatigue impacts performance in the National Hockey League (NHL). Using publicly available MoneyPuck data, the system ingests raw team-level game statistics, engineers fatigue-aware and opponent-context features, and trains regression and classification models to predict goals scored and win probability.

The key result shows that fatigue alone provides limited predictive power, but adds measurable value when combined with rolling performance and opponent defensive context.

Problem Statement

NHL teams routinely play under compressed schedules that include back-to-back games, heavy travel, and limited recovery time. While fatigue is widely believed to influence performance, its true measurable impact is difficult to isolate due to the inherent randomness of hockey outcomes.

This project addresses the following question:

How much predictive signal does scheduling fatigue provide for goals scored and win probability in the NHL?

Data Overview

The dataset was sourced from publicly available MoneyPuck NHL team-level data covering the 2017 season through the present. Each observation represents one team in one game and includes:

Goals and expected goals

Shot attempts and possession metrics

Game date

Home/away indicators

Team and opponent identifiers

Due to file size and licensing constraints, raw CSV files are not stored directly in version control. All datasets are regenerated locally through an automated data ingestion pipeline.

Feature Engineering

Multiple time-aware and context-aware features were engineered to capture team fatigue, recent form, and opponent strength.

Fatigue Features

Days of rest between games

Back-to-back game indicator

Rolling Performance Features

Five-game rolling average of goals scored

Five-game rolling average of expected goals

Fatigue-Adjusted Features

Rolling goals penalized on back-to-back games

Rolling expected goals penalized on back-to-back games

Opponent Context Features

Five-game rolling defensive expected goals for the opposing team

Opponent rest entering the matchup

All rolling features were group-wise by team, shifted forward to prevent data leakage, and filled using expanding averages early in the season to preserve sample size.

Modeling Approach

Two predictive modeling tasks were implemented:

Goals Scored (Regression)

Algorithm: Linear Regression

Target variable: Goals scored

Evaluation metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R²

Win Probability (Classification)

Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Target variable: Binary win indicator

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)

Both models use an 80/20 train-test split and include imputation for missing feature values.

Results

Goals Prediction (Regression Model)

RMSE: Approximately 1.73 goals

R²: Approximately 0.01

Single-game goal scoring remains highly stochastic, and fatigue alone explains only a small portion of scoring variance.

Win Probability Prediction (Classification Model)

Accuracy: Approximately 55%

AUC: Approximately 0.565

The win model performs measurably better than random chance, demonstrating that fatigue and opponent context provide a small but real predictive signal.

Key Insights

Fatigue alone is not sufficient to strongly predict single-game outcomes

Back-to-back games reduce rolling offensive performance

Opponent defensive context improves win probability discrimination

Scheduling effects are supplementary rather than dominant performance drivers

Overall, fatigue affects performance, but team quality and matchup factors remain the primary drivers of outcomes.

Limitations

Goalie performance is not modeled

Travel distance and time-zone effects are not directly captured

Special teams (power play and penalty kill) features are not included

Team identity is not encoded as a fixed effect

Hockey outcomes remain inherently noisy at the single-game level

Future Work

Encode team identity using fixed effects or embeddings

Add goalie-specific performance metrics

Incorporate travel distance and time-zone adjustments

Integrate power play and penalty kill features

Deploy an interactive Streamlit win-probability dashboard

Evaluate tree-based and ensemble models

Final Summary

This project demonstrates an industry-standard sports analytics workflow from raw data ingestion through feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It highlights the value of fatigue modeling while maintaining scientific honesty about its limitations. The project showcases both technical machine learning skill and applied domain understanding, making it a strong portfolio artifact for data science and sports analytics roles.
